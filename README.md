# Squirrel Play

The squirrels in Clarksville spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. 

Create a Java method called squirrelPlay that accepts an integer temperature and a Boolean. If the Boolean parameter is false then it is winter, else if it is true then it is summer. Then based upon the logic above return  a Boolean back to the main method. Return true if the squirrels play and false otherwise.

Test Data:
```
squirrelPlay(70, false) → true

squirrelPlay(95, false) → false

squirrelPlay(95, true) → true
```
